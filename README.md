# js13k-template

> Small, opinionated templates for games built for the [js13kgames](http://js13kgames.com) game jam.

This template is something I've evolved to help speed up game development for me personally. It's
not designed to be configurable or complete, but if you'd like to reuse anything you see, feel free!
