# js13k-template

> Small, opinionated templates for games built for the [js13kgames](http://js13kgames.com) game jam.

These templates are something I've evolved to help speed up game development for me personally. They
aren't designed to be complete or configurable, but feel free to reuse anything you'd like.

Contents:

- `v1` contains the gulp boilerplate I used, rougly, to build my https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2018-raven.
- `v2` is junk, skip it
- `v3` is a work in progress TypeScript version of v1
